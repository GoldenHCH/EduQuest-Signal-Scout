# Utah Board Signal Scout — Speaker Notes (short)

Use this alongside `docs/pitch_deck.md`. Each section maps 1:1 to a slide.

---

## Title
- One-liner: “We turn board meeting PDFs into an early-warning system for district buying intent.”
- Emphasize: pre‑RFP timing advantage + evidence-backed outputs.

---

## Problem
- District intent is public, but scattered and unreadable at scale.
- Most sales teams react after procurement is already underway.

---

## Stakes / Why now
- Pre‑RFP is when requirements are shaped and pilots happen.
- Post‑RFP is a commodity fight. The cost of being late is massive.

---

## Solution
- Walk through the pipeline quickly: discover → fetch → extract → evaluate → export.
- Stress that it’s automated, weekly, and produces a ranked list with sources.

---

## Product
- Point to: `signals.csv`, `top_signals.md`, Streamlit viewer.
- Emphasize “who to call, why, and what to say” (summary + evidence).

---

## Real output
- Use the Canyons example: math curriculum adoption (2nd reading) + named vendors.
- Mention the spend line is included in another signal (Amplify/McGraw Hill costs).

---

## Why we win (trust)
- “Receipts-first”: exact quotes, verified as substrings.
- Scoring + next-step recommendation makes it operational for GTM.

---

## How it works (architecture)
- LangGraph: classify → validate → score → normalize; routing drops low-signal noise.
- Weekly cron = set-and-forget monitoring.

---

## Customer + use cases
- ICP: edtech founders/AEs/SDRs, publishers, services vendors.
- Use cases: territory planning, prioritization, warm outreach, cycle tracking.

---

## Market expansion
- Utah as beachhead; easy to expand with district seed lists + discovery.
- Future: alerts + CRM triggers become daily workflow.

---

## Competitive landscape
- RFP tools are late; manual monitoring doesn’t scale.
- Differentiator: pre‑RFP + evidence validation + scoring.

---

## Traction
- End-to-end system works; demoable UI exists.
- Next traction step: pilots measuring meetings booked/time-to-first-convo uplift.

---

## Roadmap
- OCR + entity extraction + integrations are the obvious value multipliers.
- Multi-state scaling is the growth lever.

---

## Ask
- 3–5 pilot partners; distribution relationships; optional seed.
- Success metric: earlier qualified meetings and higher win-rate due to timing.
